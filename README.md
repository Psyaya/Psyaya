- 👋 Hi, I’m @Psyaya
- 👀 I enjoy learning lanuguages.  
- 👀 I'm a polyglot, and hoping this skill will transfer to computer languages too.
- 🌱 I finished the HTML/Css certificate on FREECODECAMP half a year ago, then learned a bit of Python, and made a silly text game. 
- 😅 But then stopped studying code to organize a music festival. (and forgot most of what I learned)
- 🤓 Now I am starting again with Harvard's CS50x and CS50p.
- 💞️ I’m still a newb.  Lets see where this goes.
