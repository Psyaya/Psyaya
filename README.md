- 👋 Hi, I’m @Psyaya
- 👀 I’m interested in learning lanuguages.  
- 👀 I'm a polyglot, and wondering if this skill will translate to learning computer languages now.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML on FREECODECAMP and plan to try Python next, possibly also RUST.
- 🌱 My next immediate goal is to figure out how to make the html/css pages I have created so far live on the interent for free.
- 💞️ I’m still a newb.  Lets see where this goes.
